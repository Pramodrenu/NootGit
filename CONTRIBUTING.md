- Create a branch with your name

- Try adding a file in the `students` directory with your username in 
the file title. For example, my username is **SubhrajyotiSen**, so I'd 
create a file named `SubhrajyotiSen.html`. It can be any type of files 
you want, may it be `SubhrajyotiSen.md`, `SubhrajyotiSen.txt`, or just 
`SubhrajyotiSen`.

- Add your username to `students.txt`.

- (:+1: Bonus) Sort the `students.txt`, so the file is in an 
alphabetical order.
